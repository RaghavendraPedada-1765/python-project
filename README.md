MOSRES is a Python library designed for [briefly describe the purpose of the library or tool, e.g., "generating modular resolutions for mathematical objects"]. It simplifies and automates the process of [specific functionality, e.g., "creating complex models and structures used in computational mathematics"]. 

## Features

- **Modular Design**: Easily extendable with various modules.
- **User-friendly API**: Simplifies the integration into existing projects.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and examples.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- [Any required libraries, e.g., `numpy`, `matplotlib`, etc.]

## Installation

cd mosres
pip install .
```

## Usage

Hereâ€™s a quick example of how to use MOSRES for code generation:

```python
import mosres

# Example code demonstrating the usage of MOSRES
model = mosres.create_model(parameters)
result = mosres.generate_code(model)
print(result)
```
